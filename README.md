la-cucina
=========

This is my Ludum Dare 24 entry. All the code in this repository, except
for the str_replace function in str_replace.c that was based heavily on
some code I found on the Internet (I left his original copyright notice
intact if you really want to know who wrote it) was written by myself
during the 48-hours of the competition.

Some bug fixes may have been made afterwards, see the commit logs for
details on that.
